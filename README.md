# THE BLACK MANSION :black_heart: :unicorn:



## About :books:

I haven't used Flutter and Dart in a while now and I recnetly rebuilt the API view of my blog [here](https://blckunicorn.art) and wanted to practice again and stay in shape, so I built a Flutter app to display all my posts in a neat little app for all platforms. This is that app. Enjoy. :heart:
